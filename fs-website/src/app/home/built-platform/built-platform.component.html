          <p>THE SOURCING PROCESS <span class="eng">RE-ENGINEERED</span></p>
          <p>Traditionally, sourcing the right material and the right supplier
            was a tedious and time consuming process, requiring travelling
            to tradeshows and organising physical meetings at different
            locations. Fashion Sourcing aims to re-engineer the entire process.
