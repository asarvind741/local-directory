Hi Sir,

 

Can you please elastic search on server. Please use below steps to do the needful:-

 

Step 1 — Downloading and Installing Elasticsearch
 

First, update your package index.

·         sudo apt-get update
·          
Download the latest Elasticsearch version, which is 2.3.1 at the time of writing.

wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/deb/elasticsearch/2.3.1/elasticsearch-2.3.1.deb

 

Then install it in the usual Ubuntu way with dpkg.

sudo dpkg -i 

elasticsearch-2.3.1.deb 

 

To make sure Elasticsearch starts and stops automatically with the server, add its init script to the default runlevels.

sudo systemctl 

enable elasticsearch.service

Step 2 — Configuring Elasticsearch
 
Now that Elasticsearch and its Java dependencies have been installed, it is time to configure Elasticsearch. The Elasticsearch configuration files are in the /etc/elasticsearch directory. There are two files:

·         elasticsearch.yml configures the Elasticsearch server settings. This is where all options, except those for logging, are stored, which is why we are mostly interested in this file.

·         logging.yml provides configuration for logging. In the beginning, you don't have to edit this file. You can leave all default logging options. You can find the resulting logs in /var/log/elasticsearch by default.

 

The first variables to customize on any Elasticsearch server are node.name and cluster.name in elasticsearch.yml. As their names suggest, node.name specifies the name of the server (node) and the cluster to which the latter is associated.

If you don't customize these variable, a node.name will be assigned automatically in respect to the Droplet hostname. The cluster.name will be automatically set to the name of the default cluster.

The cluster.name value is used by the auto-discovery feature of Elasticsearch to automatically discover and associate Elasticsearch nodes to a cluster. Thus, if you don't change the default value, you might have unwanted nodes, found on the same network, in your cluster.

To start editing the main elasticsearch.yml configuration file with nano or your favorite text editor.

·         sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
·          
Remove the # character at the beginning of the lines for cluster.name and node.name to uncomment them, and then update their values. Your first configuration changes in the /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml file should look like this:

/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

. . .
cluster.name: mycluster1
node.name: "My First Node"
. . .

Arvind
